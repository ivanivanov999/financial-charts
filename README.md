# Financial Charts

A web app displaying how different graph libraries' charts can be turned into Angular components with a simplified and unified API across the board.
The data formatted in our newly described API can further be delivered from an external database (in our example with Firebase Realtime Database), and the components can be re-rendered in real time.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Firebase

To setup Firebase Realtime Database, an environments file should be created first, containing all of the necessary data to access your Database.
